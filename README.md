# Quiz Creator Program

This Python program allows users to create a quiz by inputting questions, possible answers, and the correct answer. The program stores the quiz data in a `.txt` file, and the user can continue adding questions until they type `exit` to stop the program.

## Features:
- Users are prompted to input a question along with four possible answers (A, B, C, D).
- The correct answer is specified by the user.
- The program saves each question, answers, and the correct answer in a file named `user_quiz.txt`.
- The user can continue adding questions or type `exit` to end the quiz creation process.

## How to Use:
1. Run the script.
2. Enter a question when prompted.
3. Input the four possible answers (A, B, C, D).
4. Specify the correct answer.
5. Type `exit` when you are done creating the quiz to stop the program.
